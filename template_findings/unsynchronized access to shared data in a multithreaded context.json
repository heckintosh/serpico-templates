This is a typical programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework.

Note that this weakness is not unique to servlets.", "poc": null, "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Remove the use of static variables used between servlets.
