Each of these methods perform a different function and each have an associated level of risk when their use is permitted on the webserver.<paragraph></paragraph>A client can use the 'OPTIONS' method within a request to query a server to determine which methods are allowed.<paragraph></paragraph>Cyber-criminals will almost always perform this simple test as it will give a very quick indication of any high-risk methods being permitted by the server. The tool discovered that several methods are supported by the server.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>It is recommended that a whitelisting approach be taken to explicitly permit the HTTP methods required by the application and block all others.<paragraph></paragraph>Typically the only HTTP methods required for most applications are 'GET' and 'POST'. All other methods perform actions that are rarely required or perform actions that are inherently risky. These risky methods (such as 'PUT', 'DELETE', etc) should be protected by strict limitations, such as ensuring that the channel is secure (SSL/TLS enabled) and only authorised and trusted clients are permitted to use them.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#limitexcept</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
