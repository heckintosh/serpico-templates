The window.opener object records information about the original page that offered the link. If an attacker can run script on the target page, then they could read or modify certain properties of the window.opener object, including the location property - even if the original and target site are not the same origin. An attacker can modify the location property to automatically redirect the user to a malicious site, e.g. as part of a phishing attack. Since this redirect happens in the original window/tab - which is not necessarily visible, since the browser is focusing the display on the new target page - the user might not notice any suspicious redirection.", "poc": null, "remediation": "::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Specify in the design that any linked external document must not be granted access to the location object of the calling page.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:When creating a link to an external document using the &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tag with a defined target, for example _blank or a named frame, provide the rel attribute with a value noopener noreferrer.
