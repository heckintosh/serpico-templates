One of the most common uses for LDAP is to provide a Single-Sign-On (SSO) service that will allow clients to authenticate with a web site without any interaction (assuming their credentials have been validated by the SSO provider).<paragraph></paragraph>LDAP injection occurs when untrusted data is used by the web application to query the LDAP directory without prior sanitisation.<paragraph></paragraph>This is a serious security risk, as it could allow cyber-criminals the ability to query, modify, or remove anything from the LDAP tree. It could also allow other advanced injection techniques that perform other more serious attacks.<paragraph></paragraph>The tool was able to detect a page that is vulnerable to LDAP injection based on known error messages.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>It is recommended that untrusted data is never used to form a LDAP query.<paragraph></paragraph>To validate data, the application should ensure that the supplied value contains only the characters that are required to perform the required action. For example, where a username is required, then no non-alphanumeric characters should be accepted.<paragraph></paragraph>If this is not possible, special characters should be escaped so they are treated accordingly. The following characters should be escaped with a '\\':<paragraph></paragraph>* '&' * '!' * '|' * '=' * '<' * '>' * ',' * '+' * '-' * '\"' * ''' * ';'<paragraph></paragraph>Additional character filtering must be applied to:<paragraph></paragraph>* '(' * ')' * '\\' * '/' * '*' * 'NULL'<paragraph></paragraph>These characters require ASCII escaping.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246947/LDAP-Injection</paragraph><paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_injection</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 4, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
