They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.", "poc": null, "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Attack Surface Reduction:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Assign all variables to an initial value.::PHASE:Build and Compilation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Most compilers will complain about the use of uninitialized variables if warnings are turned on.::PHASE:Implementation Operation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:When using a language that does not require explicit declaration of variables, run or compile the software in a mode that reports undeclared or unknown variables.
