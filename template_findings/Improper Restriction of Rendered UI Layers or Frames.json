Without the restrictions, users can be tricked into interacting with the application when they were not intending to.", "poc": null, "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:The use of X-Frame-Options allows developers of web content to restrict the usage of their application within the form of overlays, frames, or iFrames. The developer can indicate from which domains can frame the content. The concept of X-Frame-Options is well documented, but implementation of this protection mechanism is in development to cover gaps. There is a need for whitelisting and allowing frames from multiple domains.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:A developer can use a frame-breaker script in each page that should not be framed. This is very helpful for legacy browsers that do not support X-Frame-Options security feature previously mentioned. It is also important to note that this tactic has been circumvented or bypassed. Improper usage of frames can persist in the web application through nested frames. The frame-breaking script does not intuitively account for multiple nested frames that can be presented to the user.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:This defense-in-depth technique can be used to prevent the improper usage of frames in web applications. It prioritizes the valid sources of data to be loaded into the application through the usage of declarative policies. Based on which implementation of Content Security Policy is in use, the developer should use the frame-ancestors directive or the frame-src directive to mitigate this weakness. Both directives allow for the placement of restrictions when it comes to allowing embedded content.::", "references": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
