[{"id": 479, "title": "Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "overview": "An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number. While this may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on wrapping, it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs. This becomes security-critical when the result is used to control looping, make a security decision, or determine the offset or size in behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, concatenation, etc.", "poc": null, "remediation": "::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all protocols are strictly defined, such that all out-of-bounds behavior can be identified simply, and require strict conformance to the protocol.::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY:Language Selection:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. If possible, choose a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Use libraries or frameworks that make it easier to handle numbers without unexpected consequences. Examples include safe integer handling packages such as SafeInt (C++) or IntegerLib (C or C++). [REF-106]::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Perform input validation on any numeric input by ensuring that it is within the expected range. Enforce that the input meets both the minimum and maximum requirements for the expected range. Use unsigned integers where possible. This makes it easier to perform sanity checks for integer overflows. When signed integers are required, ensure that the range check includes minimum values as well as maximum values.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Understand the programming language&amp;#x27;s underlying representation and how it interacts with numeric calculation (CWE-681). Pay close attention to byte size discrepancies, precision, signed/unsigned distinctions, truncation, conversion and casting between types, not-a-number calculations, and how the language handles numbers that are too large or too small for its underlying representation. [REF-7] Also be careful to account for 32-bit, 64-bit, and other potential differences that may affect the numeric representation.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Compilation or Build Hardening:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.::", "references": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
