These typically include user registration, or submitting emails via \"Contact Us\" pages etc. The tool has flagged this not as a vulnerability, but as a prompt for the penetration tester to conduct further manual testing on the CAPTCHA function, as The tool cannon audit CAPTCHA protected forms. Testing for insecurely implemented CAPTCHA is a manual process, and an insecurely implemented CAPTCHA could allow a cyber-criminal a means to abuse these sensitive actions.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>Although no remediation may be required based on this finding alone, manual testing should ensure that:\n 1.
