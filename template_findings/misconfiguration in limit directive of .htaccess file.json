Each of these methods perform a different function, and each has an associated level of risk when their use is permitted on the webserver. The '<Limit>' directive within Apache's '.htaccess' file allows administrators to define which of the methods they would like to block. However, as this is a blacklisting approach, it is inevitable that a server administrator may accidentally miss adding certain HTTP methods to be blocked, thus increasing the level of risk to the application and/or server.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>The preferred configuration is to prevent the use of unauthorised HTTP methods by utilising the '<LimitExcept>' directive.<paragraph></paragraph>This directive uses a whitelisting approach to permit HTTP methods while blocking all others not listed in the directive, and will therefor block any method tampering attempts.<paragraph></paragraph>Most commonly, the only HTTP methods required for most scenarios are 'GET' and 'POST'.
