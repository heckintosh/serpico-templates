An application should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking is performed when relying on input from outside a trust boundary. Do not allow your application to run with register_globals enabled. If you implement a register_globals emulator, be extremely careful of variable extraction, dynamic evaluation, and similar issues, since weaknesses in your emulation could allow external variable modification to take place even without register_globals.::", "references": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
