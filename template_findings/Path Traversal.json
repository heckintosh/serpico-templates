By browsing the application, the attacker looks for absolute links to files stored on the web server. By manipulating variables that reference files with \u201cdot-dot-slash (../)\u201d sequences and its variations, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration and critical system files, limited by system operational access control. The attacker uses \u201c../\u201d sequences to move up to root directory, thus permitting navigation through the file system.</paragraph><paragraph>This attack can be executed with an external malicious code injected on the path, like the Resource Injection attack. To perform this attack it\u2019s not necessary to use a specific tool; attackers typically use a spider/crawler to detect all URLs available.</paragraph><paragraph>This attack is also known as \u201cdot-dot-slash\u201d, \u201cdirectory traversal\u201d, \u201cdirectory climbing\u201d and \u201cbacktracking\u201d.</paragraph>", "poc": "<paragraph></paragraph>", "remediation": "<paragraph></paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal</paragraph><paragraph>http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html</paragraph><paragraph>http://www.webappsec.org/projects/threat/classes/path_traversal.shtml</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 3, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
