One method that can be used is the HTTP 'PUT' method. The 'PUT' method is mainly used during development of applications and allows developers to upload (or put) files on the server within the web root.<paragraph></paragraph>By nature of the design, the 'PUT' method typically does not provide any filtering and therefore allows sever side executable code (PHP, ASP, etc) to be uploaded to the server.<paragraph></paragraph>Cyber-criminals will search for servers supporting the 'PUT' method with the intention of modifying existing pages, or uploading web shells to take control of the server.<paragraph></paragraph>The tool has discovered that the affected path allows clients to use the 'PUT' method. During this test, the tool has 'PUT' a file on the server within the web root and successfully performed a 'GET' request to its location and verified the contents.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>Where possible the HTTP 'PUT' method should be globally disabled. This can typically be done with a simple configuration change on the server. The steps to disable the 'PUT' method will differ depending on the type of server being used (IIS, Apache, etc.).<paragraph></paragraph>For cases where the 'PUT' method is required to meet application functionality, such as REST style web services, strict limitations should be implemented to ensure that only secure (SSL/TLS enabled) and authorised clients are permitted to use the 'PUT' method.<paragraph></paragraph>Additionally, the server's file system permissions should also enforce strict limitations.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 4, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
