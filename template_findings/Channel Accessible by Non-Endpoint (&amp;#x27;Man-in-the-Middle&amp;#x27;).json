Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between the original entities.", "poc": null, "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Always fully authenticate both ends of any communications channel.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Adhere to the principle of complete mediation.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:A certificate binds an identity to a cryptographic key to authenticate a communicating party. Often, the certificate takes the encrypted form of the hash of the identity of the subject, the public key, and information such as time of issue or expiration using the issuer&amp;#x27;s private key.
