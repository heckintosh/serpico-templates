Therefore the server is unable to determine which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated or unauthenticated.<paragraph></paragraph>The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.<paragraph></paragraph>When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and how it is to be handled by the browser.<paragraph></paragraph>The 'HttpOnly' flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie. This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's session token (setting the 'HttpOnly' flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against XSS vulnerabilities themselves).</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>The initial step to remedy this would be to determine whether any client-side scripts (such as JavaScript) need to access the cookie and if not, set the 'HttpOnly' flag.<paragraph></paragraph>Additionally, it should be noted that some older browsers are not compatible with the 'HttpOnly' flag, and therefore setting this flag will not protect those clients against this form of attack.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
