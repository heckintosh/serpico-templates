The first and most secure location is to disable the 'autocomplete' attribute on the '<form>' HTML tag. This will disable 'autocomplete' for all inputs within that form. An example of disabling 'autocomplete' within the form tag is '<form autocomplete=off>'.<paragraph></paragraph>The second slightly less desirable option is to disable the 'autocomplete' attribute for a specific '<input>' HTML tag. While this may be the less desired solution from a security perspective, it may be preferred method for usability reasons, depending on size of the form.
