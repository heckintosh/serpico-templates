The contents of the executable file are controlled by the attacker and are never uploaded to the vulnerable site. <paragraph></paragraph> This vulnerability, like many other Web attacks, begins by sending a malicious link to a victim. Unlike other attacks the exploitation finishes outside of the browser context: <paragraph></paragraph> 1. The user follows a malicious link to a trusted web site\n 2. An executable file is downloaded and saved on the user's machine. All security indicators show that the file is 'hosted' on the trusted web site\n 3. The user executes the file which contains shell commands that gain complete control over the computer.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>1.
