When either of these encryption standards are used it is referred to as HTTPS.<paragraph></paragraph>Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise credentials passed from the client to the server using HTTP. This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or through network packet captures. The tool discovered that the affected page contains a 'password' input, however, the value of the field is not sent to the server utilising HTTPS. Therefore it is possible that any submitted credential may become compromised.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>The affected site should be secured utilising the latest and most secure encryption protocols. These include SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.2. While TLS 1.2 is the latest and the most preferred protocol, not all browsers will support this encryption method.
