For instance, if the names of these resources contain scripting characters, it is possible that a script may get executed in the client&amp;#x27;s browser if the application ever displays the name of the resource on a dynamically generated web page. Alternately, if the resources are consumed by some application parser, a specially crafted name can exploit some vulnerability internal to the parser, potentially resulting in execution of arbitrary code on the server machine.
