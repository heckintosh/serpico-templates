The form must perform some sort of sensitive action. 2. The victim (the administrator the example above) must have an active session. 3. Most importantly, all parameter values must be **known** or **guessable**.<paragraph></paragraph>The tool discovered that all parameters within the form were known or predictable and therefore the form could be vulnerable to CSRF.<paragraph></paragraph>_Manual verification may be required to check whether the submission will then perform a sensitive action, such as reset a password, modify user profiles, post content on a forum, etc._</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>Based on the risk (determined by manual verification) of whether the form submission performs a sensitive action, the addition of anti-CSRF tokens may be required.<paragraph></paragraph>These tokens can be configured in such a way that each session generates a new anti-CSRF token or such that each individual request requires a new token.<paragraph></paragraph>It is important that the server track and maintain the status of each token (in order to reject requests accompanied by invalid ones) and therefore prevent cyber-criminals from knowing, guessing or reusing them.<paragraph></paragraph>_For examples of framework specific remediation options, please refer to the references._</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://www.cgisecurity.com/csrf-faq.html</paragraph><paragraph>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery</paragraph><paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 4, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null, "c2_vs": null, "attack_vector": null, "attack_complexity": null, "privileges_required": null, "user_interaction": null, "scope_cvss": null, "confidentiality": null, "integrity": null, "availability": null, "exploit_maturity": null, "remeditation_level": null, "report_confidence": null, "confidentiality_requirement": null, "integrity_requirement": null, "availability_requirement": null, "mod_attack_vector": null, "mod_attack_complexity": null, "mod_privileges_required": null, "mod_user_interaction": null, "mod_scope": null, "mod_confidentiality": null, "mod_integrity": null, "mod_availability": null, "cvss_base_score": null, "cvss_impact_score": null, "cvss_mod_impact_score": null, "c3_vs": null, "severity": null, "likelihood": null, "severity_rationale": null, "likelihood_rationale": null, "nist_impact": null, "nist_likelihood": null, "nist800_total": null, "impact_val": null, "likelihood_val": null, "nist_rating": null, "language": null}]
